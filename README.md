# CakePHP Application Skeleton

A skeleton for creating applications with [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org) 3.0.

This is an unstable repository and should be treated as an alpha.

## Installation

1. Download [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) or update `composer self-update`.
2. Run `php composer.phar create-project -s dev cakephp/app [app_name]`.

If Composer is installed globally, run
`composer create-project -s dev cakephp/app [app_name]`

You should now be able to visit the path to where you installed the app and see
the setup traffic lights.

## Configuration

Read and edit `config/app.php` and setup the 'Datasources' and any other
configuration relevant for your application.
